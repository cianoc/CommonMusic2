# CommonMusic

Common Music is a music composition system that transforms high-level algorithmic representations of musical processes  
and structure into a variety of control protocols for sound synthesis and display. CommonMusic3 was reimplemented in Scheme
and CommonMusic2 bit rotted.

This is a fork of a form of CommonMusic2, where I pull out the pieces that I find useful. It is only supported on
SBCL, though it should in theory work on other platforms (I believe all the platform dependent stuff has been removed).

Over time it will probably evolve in ways that make sense to may, and possibly only me. But part of that is documentation, and
some may be cleanup.

I use this for sheet music composition (with Incudine) and for MIDI and SuperCollider. At some point I will probably use it with CSound as well.
